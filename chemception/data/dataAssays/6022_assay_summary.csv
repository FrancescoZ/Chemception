To assess the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp/MDR1) transporter, an in vitro ATPase assay from Cyprotex was used. MDR1MDCK cells obtained from the NIH (Rockville, Md., USA) were used. Following culture, the monolayers were prepared by rinsing both basolateral and apical surfaces twice with buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 C. Cells were then incubated with pH 7.4 buffer in both apical and basolateral compartments for 40 min at 37 C. and 5% CO2 with a relative humidity of 95% to stabilise physiological parameters. For the apical to basolateral study (A-B), buffer at pH 7.4 was removed from the apical compartment and replaced with loperamide dosing solutions before being placed in the companion plates. The solutions were prepared by diluting loperamide in DMSO with buffer to give a final loperamide concentration of 5 uM (final DMSO concentration adjusted to 1%). The fluorescent integrity marker Lucifer yellow was also included in the dosing solution.",Confirmatory,,

The PPlase activity of recombinant CypA or D, produced by thrombin cleavage of GST-CypA or D, was determined by following the rate of hydrolysis of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin only hydrolyzes the trans form of the peptide, and hydrolysis of the cis form, the concentration of which is maximized by using a stock dissolved in trifluoroethanol containing 470 mM LiCl, is limited by the rate of cis-trans isomerization. CypA or D was equilibrated for 1 h at 5 degrees  C. with selected test article using a drug concentration range from 0.1 to 20 nM. The reaction was started by addition of the peptide, and the change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 10 data points per second. The blank rates of hydrolysis (in the absence of CypA or D) were subtracted from the rates in the presence of CypA or D.",Confirmatory,,
