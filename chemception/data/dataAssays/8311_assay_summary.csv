IRE-1 alpha, T1 RNase, and RNase A assays carried out in vitro with several o-vanillin derivatives to demonstrate selectivity of the derivatives for IRE-1 alpha. T1 RNase was assayed as follows. Five ul of a reaction mixture comprising 1x reaction buffer (5x reaction buffer is 100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 250 mM KOAc, 2.5 mM MgCl2), 3 mM DTT, and 0.4% polyethylene glycol water were added to each well of 384 well plates. Twenty-five nanoliters of a 1 mM test compound solution were added to test wells. Three ul of a 1/48,000 dilution of an approximately 200,000 U/ml RNase T1 (Worthington) preparation were added to each test well and to positive control wells (final concentration 49.5 pg/well). Negative control wells contained only reaction mixture and test compound. After spinning the plates at 1200 rpm for 30 seconds, 3 ul of the mini-XBP-1 mRNA stem-loop substrate described in Example 1 were added to each well of a control plate.",Confirmatory,,
