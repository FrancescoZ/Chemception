The enzyme concentration used is unknown although this concentration is 10-fold lower than that of the stock solution purchased. Inhibitors were dissolved in 75% DMSO. Where inhibitors were found to be insoluble or only partly soluble in 75% DMSO, 100% DMSO was used. Reactions were activated by the addition of enzyme and agitated for 12 seconds following the addition. Absorbance readings were then taken every 20 seconds for 600 seconds.
