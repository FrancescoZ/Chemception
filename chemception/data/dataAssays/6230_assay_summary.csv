It mediates the re-uptake of uric acid from the urine into the blood. Inhibition of URAT1 leads to increased excretion of uric acid in the urine, and is therefore a potential mode of action for drugs that lower serum uric acid concentrations. Probenecid and Benzbromarone, for example, have been used clinically for treatment of gout and hyperuricemia, and they both act on URAT1 to reduce uric acid reuptake. However, benzbromarone was withdrawn from the market due to liver toxicity via mechanisms independent of URAT1, and probenecid acts on numerous transporter proteins, resulting in interactions with a variety of other drugs.An in vitro URAT1 assay is useful for identifying compounds with potential activity in lowering serum uric acid. A suitable assay involves transfection of cells (e g human embryonic kidney cells \HEK\"") with a vector encoding human URAT1.""",Confirmatory,,
