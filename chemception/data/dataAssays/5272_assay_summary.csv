Compound inhibitory activity of FabI enzyme is measured in vitro by the IC5 so determination using a fluorescence based assay.The protein FabI from S. aureus is prepared and purified using standard methods for recombinant protein expression after cloning of the gene in a prokaryotic expression vector.The biochemical activity of the FabI enzyme is assessed using the following method.The assay buffer AB contained 50 mM ADA (N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid monosodium salt) pH 6.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.006% Triton-X100 and 50 mM NaCl.The following components are added in a white polystyrene Costar plate (Ref 3912) up to a final volume of 55.5 uL: 1.5 uL DMSO or inhibitor dissolved in DMSO and 54 uL of a FabI/NADPH/NADP+ mixture in AB. After 60 min of pre-incubation at room temperature, the reaction is started by addition of 5 uL of trans-2-octenoyl N-acetylcysteamine thioester (t-o-NAC) to a final volume of 60.5 uL.",Confirmatory,,
