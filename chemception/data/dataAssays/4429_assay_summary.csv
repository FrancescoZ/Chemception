The reaction took place in a final volume of 3 mL of a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 8.0, containing 0.035 units of AChE and used a 0.35 mM solution of 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid anion. Inhibition curves were performed in triplicate by incubating at least nine inhibitor concentrations for 10 min. A triplicate sample without inhibitor was always present so as to be aware of 100% of the AChE activity.

The inhibitory activity of monoamine oxidases A and B was assessed by the Fowler and Tipton radiometric method (Biochem Pharmacol 1981, 30, 3329) using a purification of rat liver mitochondria as the source of enzymes. The inhibitory activity of MAO-B was compared to 25 ul of [14C]-phenylethylamine (PEA), 20 uM of activity, 2.5 mCi/mmol. The inhibitory activity of MAO-A was compared to 25 ul of [14C]-(5-hydroxytriptamine) (5-HT), 100 uM of activity, 0.5 mCi/mmol. Inhibition curves were performed in triplicate by incubating at least nine inhibitor concentrations for 30 min. A triplicate sample without inhibitor was always present so as to be aware of 100% of the MAO activity. The reaction took place with the addition of the substrate in a final volume of 225 ul of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 ul of rat liver mitochondria at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The reaction was carried out under continuous stirring at 37 C. for 4 minutes.",Confirmatory,,

The inhibitory activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was evaluated by the Ellman method (Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961, 7, 88) using an electric eel as an AChE neuronal model (Electrophorus electricus) and acetylthiocholine iodide (0.35 mM) as substrate. The reaction took place in a final volume of 3 mL of a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 8.0, containing 0.035 units of AChE and used a 0.35 mM solution of 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid anion. Inhibition curves were performed in triplicate by incubating at least nine inhibitor concentrations for 10 min. A triplicate sample without inhibitor was always present so as to be aware of 100% of the AChE activity. After this time, the substrate was added to 0.35 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, from a 10 mM stock solution. Loss of color was observed at 412 nm in a spectrophotometric reader having 96 well plates.",Confirmatory,,
