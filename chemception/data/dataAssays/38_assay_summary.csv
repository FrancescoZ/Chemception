Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Briefly, 6.25 .mu.L of test compound was added to each well of a 384-well plate. Enzyme (either MAO A or B) was added (12.5 .mu.L in 2.times. buffer containing 1 .mu.g protein) and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes. Finally, 6.25 .mu.L of 4.times.MAO substrate was added to each well. Following a one hour incubation, 25 .mu.L of Luciferin detection reagent was added to each well, and incubated for 20 minutes. Luminescence was then measured on an Envision microplate reader.",Confirmatory,,
