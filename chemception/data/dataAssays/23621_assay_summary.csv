The actual target(s) whereby the most active substituted trans-stilbenes inhibit the TNFa-induced activation of NF- inverted question markB remains to be identified. Resveratrol has been shown to suppress the TNF-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF- inverted question markB.38 Both IKKa and IKKss are able to catalyze the phosphorylation of p65, although through different signaling pathways,39 and are potential targets. Likewise, one or more of the kinases that activate IKK by phosphorylation, in response to TNFa or to the numerous other activators of NF- inverted question markB,35 may be the targets.",Confirmatory,,
