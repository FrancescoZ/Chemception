The inhibition of human CYP2A6-mediated 7-hydroxy coumarin formation was evaluated in the presence of 95 selected test compounds in a standard assay (Greenlee et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 1978). Our first studies were with highly purified human CYP2A6 that provided a convenient and relatively high-throughput measure of CYP2A6 inhibition.",Confirmatory,,
