The invention also provide methods for assaying for epoxide hydrolase activity as diagnostic assay to identify individuals at increased risk for hypertension and/or those that would benefit from the therapeutic methods of the invention. Any of a number of standard assays for determining epoxide hydrolase activity can be used. For example, suitable assays are described in Gill, et al., Anal Biochem 131, 273-282 (1983); and Borhan, et al., Analytical Biochemistry 231, 188-200 (1995)). Suitable in vitro assays are described in Zeldin et al. J Biol. Chem. 268:6402-6407 (1993). Suitable in vivo assays are described in Zeldin et al. Arch Biochem Biophys 330:87-96 (1996). Assays for epoxide hydrolase using both putative natural substrates and surrogate substrates have been reviewed (see, Hammock, et al.
