Human recombinant monoamine oxidase proteins MAO-A and MAO-B were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. MAOs catalyze the oxidative deamination of 1, 2 and 3 amines. In order to monitor MAO enzymatic activities and/or their inhibition rate by inhibitor(s) of interest, a fluorescent-based (inhibitor)-screening assay was set up. 3-(2-Aminophenyl)-3-oxopropamamine (kynuramine dihydrobromide, Sigma Aldrich), a non fluorescent compound was chosen as a substrate. Kynuramine is a non-specific substrate for both MAOs activities. While undergoing oxidative deamination by MAO activities, kynuramine is converted into 4-hydroxyquinoline (4-HQ), a resulting fluorescent product.The monoamine oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the conversion of kynuramine into 4-hydroxyquinoline. Assays were conducted in 96-well black plates with clear bottom (Corning) in a final volume of 100 uL. The assay buffer was 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Each experi",Confirmatory,,

The compounds of the invention can be tested for their ability to inhibit LSD1. The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit LSD1 can be tested as follows. Human recombinant LSD1 protein was purchased from BPS Bioscience Inc. In order to monitor LSD1 enzymatic activity and/or its inhibition rate by our inhibitor(s) of interest, di-methylated H3-K4 peptide (Millipore) was chosen as a substrate. The demethylase activity was estimated, under aerobic conditions, by measuring the release of H2O2 produced during the catalytic process, using the Amplex Red peroxide/peroxidase-coupled assay kit (Invitrogen).Briefly, a fixed amount of LSD1 was incubated on ice for 15 minutes, in the absence and/or in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor (from 0 to 75 uM, depending on the inhibitor strength). Tranylcypromine (Biomol International) was used as a control for inhibition. Within the experiment, each concentra",Confirmatory,,
